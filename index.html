  <h1> Jollibee: A Taste of Home for Filipinos </h1>
  <section>
    <h2> Why do Filipinos love Jollibee?</h2>
	<article> With over 900 locations in the Philippines, the Jollibee restaurant chain is wildly successful. Jollibee has branches all over the world, and for Filipinos living outside the country it has become a comforting reminder of home. Jollibee serves burgers, fries, spaghetti and fried chicken. It's American fast food, with a Filipino twist. And now it's bringing those foods back to the US to the delight of Filipinos living here. </article>
	<br />
    <article> On the Jollibee menu are familiar fast food staples, altered just enough for the Filipino palate. The hamburger's beef patty is seasoned with garlic, onions and soy sauce, or something like it. The french fries are served with the country's beloved sweet ketchup made of bananas dyed red to look like tomatoes. Fried chicken comes with either mashed potatoes or steamed rice. </article>
	<br />
    <article> It's a sentiment shared by Filipinos sitting down for a meal in crowded Jollibees from California to Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia. They're happy that the company found a recipe for the feeling of going home again, all for the price of a Yumburger. </article>

    “Vow” pays homage to people who continue to love, without expecting anything in return. Directed by Ianco dela Cruz (who helmed all previous Kwentong Jollibee materials), it tells the story of a man who fell deeply in love with “the one” from the time he first saw her at a Jollibee store. But fate led them to a different path, and the story perfectly captures how love can take on a different form and still prevail in the end.
	<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	"Crush,” meanwhile, payed tribute to those “who never gave up on love.” It also inspired netizens to maybe find their forever with a yumburger, post it and a sharpie.
	<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	“Crush” is directed by Joel Ruiz and appeals to all the hopeless romantics in us. It is a feel-good and charming tale of a young college boy who’s head-over-heels in love with his schoolmate and who chooses to express his feelings by leaving her with anonymous cheerful notes with her favorite Jollibee burger. Decades later, a homecoming event sees the boy, now an elderly man, making the same romantic gesture for the love of his life.
	<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	“Date” explores the grim realities of life and love, yet brings to light the beautiful gift of endless love. Directed by Pepe Diokno, it showed how a young boy took the effort to arrange a surprise Valentine’s dinner for his mother following his father’s instructions to the letter. The son manages to set up the perfect date with his mom, complete with her Jollibee favorites.  The mom was overwhelmed when the son shows her a video recording, which revealed that the Valentine’s date was yet another proof of her husband’s eternal love for her.
